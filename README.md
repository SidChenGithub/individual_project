# Individual Project
Sid Chen's individual project for Data Analytics for Finance

Hi there! This project is aimed to build an interactive Shiny app to show a portfolio's performance against SP500 benchmark. In the app, you can choose 5 stocks and specify their weights to build your own portfolio, then it will generate the following three panels that will help you review the portfolio's past performance and compare it with SP500.

1. A table of **average return, standard deviation, correlation with SP500, alpha, beta, and Sharpe ratios**.

2. A **Line, ribbon and rug plots** for monthly relative return of the portfolio.

3. A **Waterfall chart** to breakdown each component stock's contribution to the portfolio's overall return.
